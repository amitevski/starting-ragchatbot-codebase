# Frontend Changes - Toggle Button Design

## Overview
Implemented a theme toggle button feature that allows users to switch between dark and light themes with smooth animations and full accessibility support.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure (`frontend/index.html`)
- Updated header structure to include a flex container
- Added theme toggle button with sun/moon SVG icons
- Positioned toggle button in top-right corner of header
- Added proper ARIA labels for accessibility

### 2. CSS Styling (`frontend/style.css`)
- **Theme Variables**: Added complete light theme color variables
- **Toggle Button Styling**: 
  - Circular 50px button with hover/focus states
  - Smooth scale transitions on hover/active states
  - Icon rotation and opacity transitions (0.4s ease)
  - Proper focus ring for keyboard navigation
- **Theme Transitions**: Added 0.3s ease transitions to all theme-sensitive elements:
  - Background colors, text colors, border colors
  - All major UI components (sidebar, chat area, inputs, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Updated mobile layout to handle new header structure
- **Icon Animations**: Sun/moon icons rotate and scale with theme changes

### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`frontend/script.js`)
- **Theme Management Functions**:
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme from localStorage or defaults to dark
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between light/dark themes
  - `applyTheme()`: Applies theme and updates accessibility labels
- **Event Handlers**: 
  - Click handler for theme toggle
  - Keyboard handler (Enter/Space) for accessibility
- **Persistence**: Theme preference saved to localStorage

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Toggle Button Design
- Icon-based design with sun (light mode) and moon (dark mode) icons

- Fits existing design aesthetic with consistent styling

### ✅ Smooth Animations
- 0.3s ease transitions for all color changes
- 0.4s ease transitions for icon rotations/scaling
- Hover effects with subtle scale transform
- Active state feedback

### ✅ Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation
- Proper ARIA labels that update based on current theme
- Full keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space keys)
- Focus ring indicators matching design system
- Screen reader friendly button descriptions

### ✅ Theme System
- Complete dark/light theme implementation
- Persistent theme selection via localStorage
- Automatic theme application on page load

## Technical Implementation

### Color Scheme
- **Dark Theme**: Deep blues and grays with high contrast text
- **Light Theme**: Clean whites and light grays with dark text
- **Consistent**: Primary blue accent color maintained across both themes

### Performance
- CSS custom properties enable efficient theme switching
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Smooth transitions without layout shifts
- No external dependencies required

The toggle button is now fully functional and provides a seamless theme switching experience that enhances the user interface while maintaining accessibility standards.
